# List of sample names and parameters for fitting in plot_FPdata_pn.ipynb
# 
# Input as comma-separated fields 
#   name = name of the sample
#   number = number of data points for that sample
#   start = start of data for that sample (integer, as in Sample X2 = 2), assumes consecutive
#   dil-factor = dilution factor, assumes dilution continues to the end
#   fluor-conc = labeled protein concentration, fixed
#   type = experiment type (bind = simple binding experiment, or inhib = competitive inhibition)
#   units = units for input values, all values should be entered in the same units
